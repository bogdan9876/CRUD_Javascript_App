# 4.CRUD Javascript App: Create/Edit Pages

## In this work, you need to continue working and add two new parts to your website - Create & Edit Pages 

### Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be configured for your data format).If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.

### Bonus points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.
